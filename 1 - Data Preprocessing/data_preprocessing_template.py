# Data Preprocessing Template

#Standard preprocessing activities to be done
#before building the machine learning models
#I have excluded the missing_data and 
#encoding categorical data because they are
#not present in every dataset.

# Importing the libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Importing the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('Data.csv')
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values
y = dataset.iloc[:, 3].values

# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 0)

# Feature Scaling
#This section has been commented out because
#it is not necessary in every case.
